My fancy CV
===========

This repo contains LaTeX files to create my CV. Run ``compile.sh`` to
generate the PDF.

Requirements
------------

Requires Xelatex, Fira fonts, and FontAwesome (4!).

Updating
--------

To add new content, you'll probably want to edit ``josephcv.tex``. Some
geometry-related settings can be changed in ``limecv.cls``.

References
----------

Heavily based on https://github.com/opieters/limecv, with some
additional dummy classes for more general sections in the sidebar and
main block.
