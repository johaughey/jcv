    After being promoted to the position of shift manager I have over 
    time taken on more responsibility, and have proven that I am someone
    who can be relied upon and will not shy away from a heavy workload. Being a shift manager has taught me the importance of being 
    adaptable and flexible, having a strong work ethic, good 
    communication skills and the ability to manage time effectively. It

    As an area leader I have been tasked with leading groups of staff
    within McDonalds. To do this effectively and efficiently, I had to

    within a professional environment. I have been given the responsibility of training other members of
    staff on different areas, including service and kitchen. I
    feel I have been able to excel in training other staff because of my
    strong attention to detail. This has required me to be flexible and
    adaptable within my own role.

        such as playing both gaelic and
        soccer at both club and schools level, having a part time job at and keeping a healthy social life.
